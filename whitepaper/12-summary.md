# Closing Summary

The SWPR Dust Recovery Protocol turns forgotten, unusable micro-fragments into unified, spendable value.  
Dust is a universal problem across chains, wallets, and ecosystems.  
SWPR provides the first universal solution.

By combining detection, aggregation, conversion, distribution, and optional incentive models, SWPR transforms blockchain inefficiency into a predictable value engine for users.

The protocol is:
- non-inflationary  
- transparent  
- cross-chain  
- modular  
- user-friendly  
- verifiable  

SWPR’s recovery models allow both simple and advanced use cases:
- **Basic Conversion** for predictable value  
- **Amplified Recovery** for incentive-driven boosts  
- **Pooled Rebasing** for collective efficiency  
- **Progressive Value Return** for long-term uplift  

As the protocol expands across chains and integrates into wallets, millions of trapped micro-fragments can be reclaimed and returned to active circulation.

**Dust is no longer wasted.  
SWPR turns it into value.**

The protocol’s mission remains simple and clear:

**Turn dust into usable value — for every user, on every chain.**
