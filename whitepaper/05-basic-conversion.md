# Basic Conversion Model

The Basic Conversion Model is the foundational operating mode of the SWPR Dust Recovery Protocol.  
It describes the simplest and most predictable pathway for turning dust into usable SWPR value.

---

## Overview
Under the Basic Conversion Model, the protocol:

1. identifies dust fragments  
2. aggregates them into batches  
3. performs direct conversion into SWPR  
4. distributes the resulting value proportionally to the user  

No multipliers.  
No incentives.  
No rebasing.  
Just clean, deterministic recovery.

## Why This Model Exists
Many users and integrators prefer:
- transparency  
- consistency  
- predictability  
- direct proportional recovery  

The Basic Conversion Model satisfies these priorities.

## Conversion Logic
For each batch:

- total recoverable dust value is calculated  
- routing is selected based on efficiency  
- micro-swaps or pooling are executed  
- resulting value is delivered as SWPR  

The formula is straightforward:

No amplification or boosts apply.

## User Experience
Users see:
- detected dust  
- expected SWPR value  
- final SWPR received  
- transaction and batch logs  

Everything is explicit and easy to follow.

## When This Model Is Ideal
The Basic Conversion Model is recommended for:
- wallets integrating core recovery  
- low-volume users  
- early testing phases  
- partners who need transparent deterministic behavior  

It forms the baseline upon which all other models build.
