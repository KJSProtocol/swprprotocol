# The Solution: Unified Dust Recovery

SWPR introduces the first unified, cross-chain protocol for recovering dust — converting forgotten micro-balances into usable value.

## Core Idea
Instead of letting dust remain trapped, SWPR takes a four-step approach:

1. **Detect**  
   Scan supported chains to identify dust fragments across user wallets.

2. **Aggregate**  
   Group micro-balances into efficient batches based on chain, token family, and routing cost.

3. **Convert**  
   Transform aggregated dust into a unified token output (SWPR) through micro-swaps, pooled processes, or periodic batch cycles.

4. **Distribute**  
   Return consolidated, spendable SWPR tokens to the user.

## Why This Works
Dust fragments are individually worthless, but collectively meaningful.  
By batching and converting them, the protocol extracts value that would otherwise be permanently lost.

## A Universal Approach
SWPR avoids the fragmentation problem by:
- supporting multiple chains  
- standardizing dust handling  
- providing consistent recovery rules  
- giving users a single unified output token  

No ecosystem-specific tooling.  
No chain-specific workarounds.  
Just a simple, universal recovery mechanism.

## What Users Get
- predictable value recovery  
- transparent logs and batch IDs  
- SWPR tokens representing the recovered worth  
- optional boosts depending on the rollout model  

SWPR transforms blockchain clutter into real, unified value.
