# Rollout Phases

The SWPR Protocol launches in structured phases to ensure stability, transparency, and predictable user experience.  
Each phase adds functionality while preserving the core recovery pipeline.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Recovery (MVP)
The first version of SWPR focuses on:
- detecting dust  
- aggregating fragments  
- converting to SWPR  
- distributing recovered value  
- publishing conversion logs  

This establishes the protocol’s foundational utility.

---

## Phase 2 — Multi-Chain Expansion
Support is extended across major ecosystems:
- Ethereum  
- L2 networks  
- Solana  
- Cosmos-based chains  
- EVM-compatible sidechains  

The focus is on maximizing dust recovery coverage.

---

## Phase 3 — Recovery Models Activation
Additional models become available:
- Amplified Recovery  
- Pooled Rebasing  
- Progressive Value Return  

Users and partners can choose the model that fits their use case.

---

## Phase 4 — Wallet & dApp Integrations
Wallets and applications integrate SWPR directly:
- one-click dust scan  
- automated recovery  
- multi-chain dashboards  
- simplified user flows  

Dust recovery becomes a native user experience.

---

## Phase 5 — Ecosystem Utilities
Community applications expand around SWPR:
- liquidity pools  
- vaults  
- DEX listings  
- partner incentive cycles  

SWPR transitions from a recovery token into a utility asset.

---

## Phase 6 — Long-Term Optimization
The protocol refines:
- batch efficiency  
- cross-chain routing  
- progressive return mechanics  
- gas-optimized execution  

Each cycle improves recovery outcomes for all users.

---

## Summary
Rollout is incremental, safe, and focused on real utility.  
Every phase increases SWPR’s recovery power, ecosystem reach, and user value.
