# Token Model

The SWPR token is the unified output of the Dust Recovery Protocol.  
Its purpose is to convert fragmented, unusable dust into a single, spendable, chain-agnostic asset.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Value Representation**
SWPR represents recovered value after dust detection, aggregation, and conversion.

### 2. **Unified Output**
Instead of receiving dozens of micro-fragments from different chains, users receive one token: SWPR.

### 3. **Chain-Agnostic**
Regardless of where dust originates (Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, etc.), SWPR presents a consistent, standardized value.

### 4. **Non-Inflationary Core**
In the base model, SWPR is minted ONLY to represent recovered value.
No inflation-based rewards are used.

## Token Properties

- **Transferable** — users can hold, send, or trade SWPR.
- **Recoverable** — derived directly from micro-fragments.
- **Transparent** — conversion logs and batch IDs verify each issuance.
- **Scalable** — supports multi-chain recovery.

---

## Relationship to Recovery Models
Each recovery model modifies how SWPR is allocated or increased:

- **Basic Conversion** — 1:1 value representation  
- **Amplified Recovery** — adds incentive-based bonuses  
- **Pooled Rebasing** — proportional rebasing from pooled efficiency  
- **Progressive Value Return** — cycle-based value uplift over time  

SWPR remains the universal output token across all models.

## Token Utility
SWPR becomes valuable because it:
- consolidates unusable assets  
- standardizes recovery  
- offers predictable value  
- supports long-term participation in the protocol  
- aligns incentives between users and the ecosystem

## Summary
SWPR is not just a token.  
It is the **representation of reclaimed value** — the consolidation of dust into something usable, scalable, and unified.
