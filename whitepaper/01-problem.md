# The Problem: Dust as Lost Value

Blockchain ecosystems generate a continuous stream of “dust” — token fragments too small to spend, swap, bridge, or stake. These fragments accumulate over time, becoming permanently inaccessible to users.

## Why Dust Exists
Dust is created through normal blockchain operations:
- swap price decimals  
- liquidity pool rounding  
- bridge transfer residues  
- failed transactions  
- gas remainders  
- airdrop micros  
- staking leftovers below minimum unlock thresholds  

Every chain produces dust. Every wallet accumulates it.

## The Scale of the Problem
Individually, dust fragments are worth almost nothing.  
But across millions of wallets, the unrealized value quickly compounds into billions.

This value remains:
- locked  
- unusable  
- fragmented  
- forgotten  

No unified mechanism exists to capture it.

## The Impact
Dust creates:
- **value leakage** across the entire ecosystem  
- **loss of potential liquidity**  
- **clutter** that confuses everyday users  
- ** inefficiency** that developers cannot address at scale  

Today, dust is a universal problem with no universal solution.
