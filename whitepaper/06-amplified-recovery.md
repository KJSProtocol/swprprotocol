# Amplified Recovery Model

The Amplified Recovery Model introduces optional incentives that increase a user’s recovered value beyond the raw dust amount.  
It adds growth mechanics without changing the core workflow of detection → aggregation → conversion → distribution.

---

## Purpose
Amplified Recovery exists to:
- reward early adopters  
- encourage repeated use  
- incentivize dust cleanup across chains  
- increase ecosystem participation  
- provide a gentle value-growth mechanic  

It layers on top of the Basic Model while remaining predictable and verifiable.

## How Amplification Works
After conversion, the user receives:

The amplification bonus may depend on:
- protocol phase  
- user participation  
- network growth rate  
- batch efficiency  
- ecosystem incentives  

Amplification never reduces user value — it only adds to it.

## Incentive Types

### 1. **Early User Boost**
Higher multipliers during the earliest protocol phases.

### 2. **Frequency Boost**
Rewards users who:
- recover dust consistently  
- return for multiple cycles  
- integrate dust recovery into regular wallet use  

### 3. **Efficiency Bonus**
If batching significantly reduces conversion cost, a portion of the savings is shared with the user.

### 4. **Promotional Cycles**
Temporary multipliers during:
- launches  
- integrations  
- event-driven cycles

## Safeguards
Amplification follows fixed rules:
- no negative outcomes  
- no unpredictable inflation  
- bonuses are capped and transparent  
- logs show the exact bonus received  

---

## Why This Model Matters
Amplified Recovery encourages:
- user engagement  
- liquidity growth  
- cross-chain cleanup  
- community participation  
- faster protocol adoption  

It provides a value-positive layer without adding volatility.

---

## Summary
Amplified Recovery is a simple enhancement layer:  
**same workflow, more value returned.**

It is optional, non-inflationary, and fully transparent.
