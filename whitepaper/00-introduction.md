# Introduction

The SWPR Dust Recovery Protocol is designed to unlock the hidden value trapped in dust — the tiny, unusable token fragments that accumulate across wallets and chains.

Dust is everywhere:
- failed swap leftovers  
- bridge fragments  
- gas remainders  
- airdrop micros  
- staking scraps beneath minimum thresholds  

Individually, these fragments are worthless.
Collectively, they represent billions in dormant value.

SWPR provides a unified recovery mechanism that scans, aggregates, converts, and returns this forgotten value to users — turning dust into spendable SWPR tokens.

This whitepaper explains the system, its components, its value model, and the rollout structure behind the protocol.
