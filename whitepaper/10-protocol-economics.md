# Protocol Economics

SWPR’s economic model is built on efficiency, not inflation.  
The protocol converts dust into unified value without relying on dilution-based incentives.

## 1. Non-Inflationary Core
SWPR is issued only when:
- dust is recovered  
- value is created  
- conversion results are verifiable  

No staking emissions.  
No arbitrary rewards.  
No inflation loops.

---

## 2. Value Creation Through Efficiency
The protocol generates value by:
- batching dust  
- reducing swap and gas costs  
- improving routing  
- aggregating micro-fragments into larger convertible amounts  

Efficiency → Value.

This is the economic engine of SWPR.

## 3. Model-Dependent Additions
Each recovery model affects economics differently:

- **Basic Conversion** — neutral, pure value conversion  
- **Amplified Recovery** — controlled incentive multipliers  
- **Pooled Rebasing** — value lift from grouped efficiency  
- **Progressive Value Return** — long-term uplift from cycle improvements  

All remain mathematically capped and transparent.

## 4. Ecosystem Effects
When users continuously recover dust:
- value that was lost becomes active  
- liquidity increases  
- token fragmentation decreases  
- chain clutter reduces  
- ecosystem health improves  

SWPR aligns user incentives with ecosystem cleanup.

## 5. Alignment and Sustainability
The protocol is designed so that:
- users gain value  
- the ecosystem gains efficiency  
- wallets and partners gain utility  
- no one is penalized or diluted  

No inflation.  
No complexity.  
Pure efficiency turned into usable value.
