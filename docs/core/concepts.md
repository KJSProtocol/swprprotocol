# Core Concepts

This page defines the essential ideas that make the SWPR Protocol work.

## Dust
Tiny, unusable token fragments that accumulate in every wallet due to:
- swap decimals
- bridge leftovers
- gas fragments
- airdrop micros
- staking residues

## Aggregation
SWPR detects and groups dust balances across chains and wallets into a recoverable form.

## Conversion
Collected dust is translated into a unified value format (SWPR), giving users something spendable instead of fragments.

## Recovery Engine
The decentralized system that:
1. scans supported chains  
2. identifies dust sources  
3. batches micro-value  
4. performs the conversion  
5. returns unified value to the user  

## Tokenized Output
The SWPR token represents the reclaimed (and sometimes amplified) value of previously useless dust.
