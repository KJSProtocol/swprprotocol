# How to Recover Dust with SWPR

This guide explains the simplest possible version of using the SWPR Protocol to recover dust.

## Step 1 — Initiate a Dust Scan
The user triggers a scan through a:
- wallet integration  
- dApp interface  
- simple “Scan for dust” button  

The protocol checks supported chains and identifies recoverable dust fragments.

## Step 2 — Review Detected Dust
The interface shows:
- token type  
- chain  
- fragment amount  
- whether it qualifies as dust  

Users can approve or reject the scan.

## Step 3 — Approve Recovery
Once approved, the protocol:
- groups dust into batches  
- prepares the conversion route  
- estimates expected SWPR output  

## Step 4 — Conversion
Dust is converted into SWPR using:
- micro-swaps  
- pooled conversion  
- scheduled batch cycles  
(depending on rollout model)

## Step 5 — Receive SWPR
Users receive:
- recovered value in SWPR  
- optional boosts (if applicable)  
- transaction and conversion logs  

SWPR replaces previously unusable dust with unified, spendable value.
