# SWPR Protocol — Turn Dust Into Value

SWPR is a universal dust recovery engine for Web3 that detects, aggregates, and converts trapped **crypto dust** into clean, usable value.

This repository hosts the core documentation, specs, and resources for the SWPR Protocol.

## What is SWPR?

Every wallet, on every chain, leaks value over time:

- Leftover decimals from swaps and bridges  
- Gas fragments  
- Abandoned airdrop balances  
- Stranded micro-tokens users never touch again  

Individually they are too small to move efficiently. At scale, they represent **billions in trapped value**.

**SWPR Protocol** introduces a clean, protocol-driven way to:

1. Detect dust fragments across supported chains  
2. Aggregate them into deterministic recovery pools  
3. Convert them into unified, spendable SWPR units

## Repository layout

- `README.md` — high-level overview and entry point  
- `docs/` — protocol documentation for users, wallets, and partners  
- `specs/` — technical specifications for implementers and auditors  

(Whitepaper and additional docs will be added as the project evolves.)

## Status

**Phase:** Identity & Foundation  
**Mode:** Design + documentation  
**Objective:** Define a clear, credible base for the SWPR dust recovery engine.
